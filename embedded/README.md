# SkyGuardian Embedded

The **SkyGuardian Embedded** project is the heart of our emergency connectivity solutionâ€”designed to operate on drones and other remote platforms. This folder contains all the embedded code that runs on devices (such as Raspberry Pi) to create temporary, low-power cellular base stations in areas where traditional signals fail.

## Overview

When conventional communication networks break down in remote areas, the SkyGuardian Embedded system kicks in. Its primary functions include:

- **Drone-Based Connectivity:**  
  Operating on a drone, the system creates a localized cellular network using modules. This network provides stranded users with a limited period of connectivity.

- **Automatic SMS Notification:**  
  Upon detecting a connection (e.g., via an incoming call or connection event), the system automatically sends an SMS to the connecting device with critical instructions.

- **Emergency Data Handling:**  
  The module triggers an HTTP endpoint to register connection events and location data, aiding in rescue coordination.

## Key Components

- **controller.py:**  
  Main code that initializes the module, monitors serial communication for connection events, and sends SMS notifications. It also calls a backend endpoint to log emergency events.

- **Unit Tests:**  
  Located in the `tests/` directory, these tests simulate serial communication and verify that the system correctly processes incoming events, sends SMS messages, and triggers external endpoints.

- **Simulation Tools:**  
  Virtual serial port setups and mocks allow testing of the embedded functionality without requiring actual hardware.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**  
- **PySerial:** Used for serial communication with the module.
- **Requests:** For sending HTTP requests to backend endpoints.
- **Drone/Hardware Platform:** (For full deployment) A Raspberry Pi or similar device to run the embedded software, along with the corresponding hardware module.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skyguardian.git
```
2. **Navigate to the Embedded Directory**
```bash
    cd the-stackoverflows/embedded/
```
3. **Install the dependency**
```bash
    ./.venv/bin/pip install pyserial
```

## Running the Embedded Code
To start the embedded code on your device (e.g. Raspberry Pi), run:
```bash
    python3 controller.py <serial_port>
```
Replace `<serial_port>` with the correct serial port path (e.g. `/dev/ttyS0` or a virtual serial port for testing).

## Testing
Unit tests for the embedded system can be executed from the embedded directory:
```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```
These tests simulate module responses, serial communication events, and validate the proper functioning of the SMS notification and HTTP endpoint triggering.
